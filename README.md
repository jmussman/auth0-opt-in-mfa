# Auth0-Opt-In-MFA

## Overview

Customer identity cloud scenarios may benefit from passwordless and multi-factor authentication, but in CIC
the user needs to opt-in for this instead of having it forced upon them.
This action is designed to look for the opt-in and check to see if the user is not enrolled with MFA,
and if not trigger enrollment during the login process.

This is one of a series of action examples that may be used as a foundation for building
what you need.
Search GitHub for *jmussman/auth0* to find other examples in the series.

## Implementation

The implementation looks at the user profile for a 'mfaOptIn' attribute set to true in the user
metadata.
If the opt-in attribute is set, it checks the multifactor list for the user via the event object.
If no MFA is set, it triggers passkey enrollment before the login flow proceeds.

Changing the opt-in attribute to false or removing it causes the action to skip the check for passkeys and
triggering enrollment.
The customer portal can clear the MFA registration if the user opts-out.
If the registration is not cleared and the user re-opts-in, then the original MFA continues to work.
This may be the desired behavior.

## Configuration

This assumes basic knowledge of working with actions and adding actions to flows in Auth0.
This is an overview of the configuration that must be established.

### Steps

1. Create a new post-login action using the code in the *auth0-opt-in-mfa.js* file.
4. Add a secret *mfaTypes* with a list of desired types: otp, recovery-key, etc. The types selected must be enabled in Security -> Mult-factor Auth. Also, the toggle Customize MFA Factors during Actions must be enabled. There are limits as to which factor enrollments or challenges may be triggered during an action, check the documentation for current restrictions.
5. Add a secret *debug* with a value of true for console messages during testing, clear it for production. A re-deployment is neccessary after changing a secret.
6. Save and deploy the action in the post-login flow.
